Shell, Init Files, Variables, and Expansions Project

In this project, I explored initialization files, local and global variables, and special parameters within the Shell environment. Additionally, I practiced using expansions, performed arithmetic operations, and utilized aliases to streamline Shell commands.

This project consisted of various tasks, each designed to enhance my understanding of Shell scripting, variable manipulation, and efficient command execution. From creating aliases to performing arithmetic operations, I gained valuable insights into customizing and automating tasks in the Unix/Linux Shell.


    0-alias: Creates an alias named ls with the value rm *.
    
    1-hello_you: Prints "hello user," where "user" is the current Linux user.
    
    2-path: Adds /action to the PATH.
    
    3-paths: Counts the number of directories in the PATH.
    
    4-global_variables: Lists environment variables.
    
    5-local_variables: Lists all local variables, environment variables, and functions.
    
    6-create_local_variable: Creates a new local variable named BEST with the value "School."
    
    7-create_global_variable: Creates a new global variable named School with the value "Best."
    
    8-true_knowledge: Prints the result of 128 added to the value stored in the environment variable TRUEKNOWLEDGE, followed by a new line.
    
    9-divide_and_rule: Prints the result of POWER divided by DIVIDE, where POWER and DIVIDE are environment variables.
    
    10-love_exponent_breath: Displays the result of BREATH to the power of LOVE, where BREATH and LOVE are environment variables.
    
    11-binary_to_decimal: Converts a number in base 2 stored in the environment variable BINARY to base 10.
    
    12-combinations: Prints all possible combinations of two letters (except "oo") in lowercase from 'a' to 'z', one combination per line, in alphabetical order.
    
    13-print_float: Prints a number stored in the environment variable NUM with two decimal places.
    
    14-decimal_to_hexadecimal: Converts a number in base 10 stored in the environment variable DECIMAL to base 16.
    
    100-rot13: Encodes and decodes text using the rot13 encryption.
    
    101-odd: Prints every other line from the input, starting with the first line.
    
    102-water_and_stir: Adds the two numbers stored in the environment variables WATER and STIR, then prints the result in base behlnort.    0-alias: Creates an alias named ls with the value rm *.
