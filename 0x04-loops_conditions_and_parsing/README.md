Loops, conditions and parsing

In this project, I focused on using loops and conditional statements in Bash scripting. I also practiced parsing and manipulating data from log files, specifically Apache access logs. Here's a brief overview of the tasks:

[apache-access.log(1)]([./apache-access.log(1)): An Apache access log file parsed in tasks 102 and 103.
