Shell permissions

This project was a part of a series focusing on mastering the fundamentals of shell scripting and the Unix/Linux command-line environment. In the "Shell Permissions" project, I delved into the intricacies of managing file permissions, access control, and security in Unix-based systems. I learned how to manipulate and configure permissions for files and directories, controlled access for different users and groups, and understood the significance of read, write, and execute permissions. By the end of this project, I had gained a solid grasp of Unix/Linux permissions, enabling me to secure my files and directories effectively and manage access rights like a pro.

This project was a valuable step in my journey to becoming proficient in shell scripting and system administration, laying the foundation for more advanced topics in the world of Unix/Linux.
