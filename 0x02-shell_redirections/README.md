Shell, I/O Redirections and filters

In this project, I mastered various Shell commands such as head, tail, find, wc, sort, uniq, grep, and tr to manipulate standard input and output. I also learned how to combine commands effectively and make use of special characters for text filtering.

This project involved a series of practical tasks, each designed to reinforce my understanding of these essential Shell concepts and commands. From printing "Hello, World" to advanced log parsing, this project covered a wide range of Shell capabilities, making me proficient in working with files, text, and data in Unix/Linux environments.
